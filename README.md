# Machine Learning Coding Assignments

## Decision Trees
The model is used to determine whether a car is fast or not based on provided attributes.

Inside ```decision_trees/``` you will find:
 - Training dataset ```id3_data.csv```
 - Test dataset ```id_test_data.csv```
 - The model ```ID3.py```
 - Sample output of the model decision tree ```id3_fast_tree_sample.png```
 - The saved model after training ```id3_fast_model.pkl```

 ## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
 The model code is in ```ANN.py```. The dataset is defined in the file itself. The file will output the final matrix weights of each layer.
